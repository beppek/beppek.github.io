#### My story

I haven't always been a programmer, but I have always been a computer nerd. My story took a bit of a detour for most of my 20's, I usually say I took the scenic route in life: after high school I stayed in my home town and worked for 2 years, saving up money before taking a plunge out into the great unknown when I moved to Canada at the age of 21. I stayed in Canada for 1 year and gained some valuable experience of life outside my own native Sweden. Travelling solo and making friends just made me want more, so it's not surprising that I soon found myself moving to Australia for what was originally meant to be roughly 1 year but turned into 2.

Once my time in Australia was up I returned home to find most of my friends well into their careers and while my years of travelling had given me invaluable experience, it had not given me a stable foundation to build a career upon. So, while working as a bartender in Stockholm I came into contact with some employees of one of Sweden's most well known tech start ups which inspired me to dive into web design and programming.

At first I took a couple of courses, at the same time as I was working behind the bar. But after the new year 2015 I quit my job, applied for a few more courses (all online) and took off to Australia again for another 6 months while studying remotely from Sweden.

This is the point where my story could have taken a different turn. This is where I could have realised how hard it is to be a remote student, forced to plan my own time, working in a completely different time zone (I was 8-10 hours ahead of my University) and missed deadlines. Instead, I loved it! So I applied for Sweden's most popular remote IT programme: Web Programmer at Linneaus University. Worried that I wouldn't make the cut I also applied for about 15 other courses but as fate would have it, I was accepted!

The first year was extremely good. The tempo was high, much higher than previous remote studies I had done, and this was a good thing. It was really clear to us that we were learning a lot, and we were learning it at a rapid pace, going from hacking away in HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript for the browser to be able to write an entire backend in NodeJS and finishing off with a [project](https://shuttersnappy.com) in AngularJS - all in the first year.

#### Today

I am currently in the second of three years in the programme at Linneaus University which will result in a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The education is of high class and is surfing right at the fore-front of current technologies. The best part of it is that it is all online. The programme runs parallell with campus with lectures streamed live and slots for personal tutoring with one of the teachers available for booking every week.

As you can tell I'm loving the education, and since I do I would love to get even more real world experience doing something that I am passionate about, which is why you can find this page. It aims to show you what I can do and convince you that I am the right man for the job.

#### Personal

Other than programming I find myself drawn to the world of travelling, writing and photography. I am a regular contributor (and creator) of [Backpack Vagabond](http://www.backpackvagabond.com) - an opinionated travel blog which also features a lot of my photography. A seperate, dedicated, photography site is currently in the planning stages and will be a point of sale for my photography.

As a frequent traveller I am a fervent fan of diversity - one of the few things I don't tolerate is intolerance. I have often travelled alone and enjoy the feeling of freedom as I know that I only have myself to rely on.

As a result of my long time travelling as a lone individual I often find myself stepping forward in groups, taking responsibility and aim to lead by example. When I find myself to be less knowledgable than someone else I listen and ask questions, something I've picked up from my travels when you often find yourself at the mercy of a new culture, one that often will confuse you as to its inner workings.

Please, feel free to [contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) me with questions, comments or virtual anthrax.

I look forward to hearing from you.
