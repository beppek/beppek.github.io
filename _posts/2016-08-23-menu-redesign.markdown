I am turning over a new leaf with this site. Step by step it is starting to look better and better. From the beginning my goal was to make the menu into a hybrid between a profile snapshot and site navigation. I think I have almost succeeded now.

The menu relies on heavy use of SASS, like all my styles really and is triggered by jQuery which I brought in for this purpose.

There are a few fine tuning adjustments left to do but for now this is fine. The image of my face will be updated with a new one (one where both my eyes are equally open) and instead of having a link to my current - rather poor - contact page; I might add a mailto link, a contact app or just a link to a contact form.

On mobile the navigation will take upp full screen width, otherwise it will look exactly the same as on desktop.

The about page will also be completely reworked. Either as a brand new page with brand new text, or as a modal that pops up. I guess it depends on the final copy of that page.

#### To do
Following is a list of things I have left to do before the site is updated. There is no particular order.

- Rewrite About
- Fix Contact
- Redesign Portfolio
- Repair the broken mobile design
- Change the profile picture
- Add playground for small apps and games to show off
- Add categories to posts
- Show other recent posts after post content and before comments
- Pagination on blog page
- Clear blog of redundant posts

That's it for now. Actually I think I will add this as a page on the site for now. I will also stop pushing to git temporarily (as it publishes everything and currently I would rather wait until the site is ready). I will still commit my changes though.
