I'm feeling about done with the page for now.
There are still many things I want to - and need to - do.

For example adding the contact page exposed a problem with the menu design: the contact link is not aligned well with the other links.
It's not a big problem, would only take a few minutes of rewriting some SASS, but I have other priorities for now.

Next up will be to go live.
