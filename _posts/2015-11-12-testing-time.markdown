Since the first post was only really edited it's time for me to create my first post by myself.

I'm slowly wrapping my head around all this, piece by piece.

The examination assignment is absolutely awesome, and definitely really useful.
I've long been irritated with the amount of repetitions in the CSS files,
and since I'm someone who is insanely obsessed with efficiency this has always been a big thorn in my eye and prevented me from appreciating CSS all the way.

HTML on the other hand is not as annoying to be working in,
at least not in IDEs like Sublime where a simple tab after typing a few letters of the tag name will render both an opening and closing tag.
On the other hand, it is highly annoying having to constantly update the menu when new pages are added so that is a very welcome addition and it's nice to know it can be done without the need for a database or platform like WordPress when one isn't needed otherwise.
Writing markdown is also something I'm already getting into. It's a quick and easy way to produce the documents you need. Text is for text if you get my drift, it's free from distractions like tags and so on.

In any case, I will share my opinion on all of these things in later posts.
This is just my initial opinion, it might change, or at least it should get more informed as I go.

The only thing I have to "complain" about so far is that we haven't really been pointed in the right direction for where to find all the info we need.
Other than the Jekyll site itself there is a striking lack of links on the course page.
It wouldn't hurt to have a section on the course page with useful links, all of them gathered in one place.
That's where you'd find links to information on for example markdown, SASS, robots.txt, humans.txt and all other things related to this course - big or small.

But for now I will just continue to dig out the information by myself, using random internet dudes as teachers. It seems to have worked well so far at least.
