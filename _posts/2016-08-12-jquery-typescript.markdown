Since I recently started to dabble in TypeScript and I am yet to implement any kind of JavaScript on this site I figured I might as well write all of it in TypeScript as a way to learn some more. Sounds like a great idea right?

Before getting started I had to find out how to do this. Turns out it is quite simple: all you need is the typings file which you can find at ___. Then grab the jQuery files and you are good to go.
