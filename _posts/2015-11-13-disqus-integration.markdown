The work on the site is chugging along just fine.
I've been playing around now with creating new pages and doing other minor random changes, like adding more links on the Resources page.

Those news are not really that big.
The real thing I wanted to talk about in this post was the recent Disqus Integration into the blog posts of this site.

It's really straight forward system to install.
Since I had my name registered to a travel blog I created about a year ago \(and managed to kill by now\), I had to manually change the shortname in the Disqus text I integrated on the posts layout.

There really was nothing to it, other than adding a couple of tags and the Disqus code in between the tags, then registering the new page on Disqus.

The advantage to using Disqus for comments is that lots of people already have a Disqus profile and it's a really easy setup.

Too easy, like they say down under.

Right now the text is going to appear too bright to read as I've set it for a dark background in the Disqus settings.
That might tell you something about my planned changes to the design of the page.
I'm a big fan of darker layouts when done right as I feel they're easier on the eyes.
But that might just be me since I'm a big ol' night owl.
