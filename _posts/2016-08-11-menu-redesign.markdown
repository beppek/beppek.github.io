As a part of my redesign of the site I started with the menu. After fighting a little bit with changing my initial design, made almost a year ago, I finally got it to work out the way I wanted to. I have had some help from a new acquaintance: Blisk - a great browser geared at developers. I will write a post about it later on once I have gotten a bit further with this project.
