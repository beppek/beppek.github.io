It took just about no time at all to get the site responsive again.
Good thing, I even managed to restyle the mobile nav menu a bit.

The plan down the road is to have a slide in menu for all screen sizes.

In the most recent update I seperated the Disqus code from the post.html document and put it in its own.
That way it's easier to integrate in other parts as well should I decide to later on.

So instead of going live at 7pm I should now be ready by 4pm, I'm planning on adding some photos to show off my huge interest in photography,
as well as change some of the text on the about page and get a better home page.
