Now that the posts look nice (somewhat), I'm going to work on making the blog feed look nicer. I am planning on bringing in a masonry like grid. I saw a minimalist JavaScript library that might be able to do the trick the other day so I will see if I can make that happen nicely.

The plugin can be found [here](http://www.cssscript.com/tiny-masonry-like-javascript-grid-library-tiny-masonry-js/).

So, next up will be to bring in the grid. After that comes jQuery in TypeScript and fixing up the mobile version of the site. Then I can start working on "The Playground" which is where I intend to have some smaller programs and apps that I create just for fun.
