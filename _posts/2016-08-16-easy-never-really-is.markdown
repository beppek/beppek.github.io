I should have learnt by now that if something seems easy it rarely - if ever - really is. The masonry grid seemed easy enough to implement but of course it wasn't. Well, the grid works (after fighting one or two initial problems with how to load it) but it is not responsive whatsoever. Now, I could probably sit down and make the grid responsive, but then I may just as well write the whole thing myself.

So I went searching the NPMJS library for another masonry grid and I was unable to make the top selection there work at all, for some reason the css file refused to load. This might be due to my own technical limitations after a whole summer of being away from coding, or it may be due to some other thing that I have missed. But for now I just feel too tired to try to fix it.

Instead I think I've decided to drop the masonry grid and instead work on what might be a better solution for a non-photographic blog anyway and just display the posts as a list like I currently do but restyle it a bit to make it look nicer. Also I am considering dropping the dark background and going for a light background with dark text. Or, more likely, I will let the user make the choice themselves in a settings app that will appear on the site sometime in the not too distant future.
