The classic post everyone has to make the very first time they post something, a test post if you like. So I'm making one as well, why not right?

The thought behind this site is that it's going to serve as my personal portfolio.
So this is a site that I will continue to work on and update as I get better and increase my understanding of the web and all it's components.
