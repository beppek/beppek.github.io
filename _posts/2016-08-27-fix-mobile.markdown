Today I decided that I wouldn't do any further work on the site until I'd fixed the broken mobile nav. So after some tinkering before and after work I finally got it primed and ready to tackle a bunch of mobile devices, so long as they don't tilt them into landscape mode, in which case I'm screwed.

I am currently using jQuery but I don't really use it for anything more useful than I can do with just a few lines of vanilla JS or TS code. So another project will be to migrate away from jQuery as I just don't really see the point any more.
