The better part of the afternoon has been spent playing around with SASS.
I must say I find it really useful. The simple calculations you can do are awesome.

Also using "variables" to store information is really handy.
When I want to change it I don't have to go through all the places I've used it in all the different files.
I just change it in one place and it's there.

The downside is the debugging as it gets harder when all is spread in different files.

I think I remember Johan saying something about that, but right now I'm just hungry and need to take a little break.

There are still a few things left to do before I have a good first draft of the design.
It's not responsive anymore, not since I broke the design and moved everything around.

I know they say you should go mobile first, but that's not always true.
I think in the case of when you're building a portfolio site mobile can come second.

But as always: I might be dead wrong.
