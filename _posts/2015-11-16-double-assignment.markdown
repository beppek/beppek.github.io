Waking up realising you have 2 assignments due on the exact same day is never fun.
One of the main reasons I decided to get on a program was so that I wouldn't have to do 2 assignments or more on the same day.
You'd wish there was some kind of coordination as it obviously means one (or both) of the courses will get less than maximum effort.

But this is the way it is now, the game is rigged so you might as well do your best to play after faulty rules.

The plan for the day is to make the site responsive again and hopefully go live by 7pm tonight.
I need to test out a few more things once the site is up so that would be great.

I'll keep posting more as I get further along the way.
