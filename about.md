This website is my portfolio, blog and kinda just where I like to hang out and chill. 
Basically this is my playground.

I will - for the sake of this assignment - do a little longer introduction of myself here in case anyone is interested. 
This about page will be changed later on, the information is too long and detailed. 
I doubt anyone actually cares about all the little details of my life. 
I just thought course mates and teachers might be interested to get to know me better.

###So who am I?

Well, I'm a dude who happened to be born in Sweden in the first half of 1987. 
The Berlin wall was still separating East from West, 
the internet was not a thing most people knew or cared about,
and computers were not a part of every man's daily life.
Basically life was pretty shitty.

These days I love to geek away. Programming has grown to be one of my main interests, photography has always been around leading to a deep interest in Photoshop.
Of course I love to travel, I mean who doesn't? I just like to think I'm really cool since I mostly travel completely solo and make friends along the way.

To stay fit I lace up my shoes, play some floorball and score some goals.

If you're not interested in reading my story all the way that top part was my tl;dr, you can skip the rest now.

####Early Years

No? Ok then here goes: I was lucky to have been born with a father who was working in IT, so we always had a computer at home,
long before most of my friends did.
I always enjoyed games, but must admit I was never any good at them,
so instead I found my way into making those awesome 90's websites and editing photos before I even knew how to speak English.

Of course, back then the web was something completely different, but it helped define me, and my whole generation as well as all generations to come.

I took a course in web design back in my last year in Gymnasiet (High School in Sweden). 
Of course things were completely different back then: Flash was king of the hill, JavaScript was spat on and AJAX was so new I don't think my teacher had even heard about it.

####Holy shit! I'm supposed to be some kind of adult now?

After I graduated there was a bit of panic growing inside, as I guess it is with most kids that are all of a sudden thrown out into the world, expected to survive.
I was mostly really relieved though, school was stifling and I made a vow to never go back - good thing one can change one's mind.
Instead I decided to go travel for a bit - 7 years - and see the world. 
I lived and worked in Canada, Norway and Australia and travelled to many other places.
During that time I tried a bit of everything and was really mostly trying to focus on becoming a photographer to enable further travelling through work.
It wasn't really working out; the competition is fierce for a travel photographer. So I started to look for alternatives.
But it wasn't until one day in spring 2014 that I - sick and tired of tending bar - came up with the idea that I could become a programmer.
There was only one problem: I'd never programmed anything before. 
All I'd done in the past was to write some HTML code with inline CSS.

This was going to be hard.

####New Life

Naturally I decided to dip my toes before I jumped in. 
First I refreshed my HTML and CSS knowledge at codecademy, but when it came time for JavaScript I was lost.
I really didn't understand when and why I needed to use *semicolons, var, parenthesis* and all the other little concepts that are completely alien to anyone who has never actually inspected a single line of code before.

But I'm not one to let what I don't know stop me.

So I applied and jumped head first into a part time course in web development, still working full time. 
That was about to change.

I applied for more courses the following semester and ended up studying full time, remotely at 2 Swedish Universities - but there's a twist: I was studying from Melbourne, Australia.
I gambled some more and quit my job, not that I've ever found those hard to come by. 
Mostly the question would be whether I had the discipline to pull off remote studies.
Hint: it worked out fine.

The only problem was that I was only studying a whole bunch of free standing courses, 
if I was to keep this up I'd die of a heart attack before I'd even finish studying.
When you're running 3-4 courses simultaneously it's really common for them to have assignments due on the same date.
Of course it means you can't give everything your fullest attention.

So you can imagine how happy I was to get into my first selection: Web Programmer at Linneaus University - the closest university to my very home town. 
It's a 2 year program with raving reviews. The courses in the program really appealed to me which is why I set my sights on it from the start.

####The Present

A few courses into the program and I'm just getting more and more satisfied with my choice.
This is a good program, the tempo is high, and most importantly: we're learning really useful stuff.

I'm also in a bit of a situation: I made the mistake of falling in love with a fair maiden while fighting spiders and sharks during my 2 year voyage to the land down under.
Now we're stuck on opposite sides of the planet, awaiting her visa to come live and work in Sweden to be approved.

####The Future

I will be the next Elon Musk.

*Thanks for reading. Bye.*
