I'm a dude who happened to be born in Sweden in the first half of 1987.
The Berlin wall was still separating East from West,
the internet was not a thing most people knew or cared about,
and computers were not a part of every man's daily life.
Basically, life was crap.

Good thing the internet boom of the 90's came to the rescue.
I got to ride the wave early on as my dad worked in IT and we always had a computer at home,
long before any of my friends did.

I created some of those old school websites of the 90's,
you know kinda like the Space Jam [website](http://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm) that has miraculousy survived.

In high school I took a course in web design, but this was back in the day when Flash was all the rage and JavaScript was kinda frowned upon.

When I graduated I was over school, I wanted to do anything rather than study anymore.
So I went travelling - for 7 years. Because that seemed like a sane thing to do.

My first big adventure to Canada back in 2008 kicked off a strong passion for photography.
I bought my first SLR as a christmas gift for myself and started to learn the basics by trial and error combined with reading tons of material online and in books.
Nowadays I'm really into the mirrorless systems by Sony, they're just so fast - it's awesome!

After some years on the roam, I was tired of not having a base - a place to call home. So I decided to turn my life around and started to study web design and web programming, first at Malm√∂ University and later I got into one of Sweden's most popular remote programs in IT at Linnaeus University. I soon found myself more drawn towards the programming aspect of the web rather than the visual design.

At the end of the first year I had the opportunity to do whatever I wanted for an end of the year project. The result was [ShutterSnappy](https://shuttersnappy.com). An app that allows anyone to create a photographic challenge that any registered user can join and then vote for their favourite contributions. The app is created with the MEAN stack.

My preference lies in the world of JavaScript, but I am no stranger to C# and PHP, I've even looked into Java though I am by no means an expert.
