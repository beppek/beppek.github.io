This is me:

![Beppe Karlsson](/img/beppe_s.png "This is me")

I'm a dude who happened to be born in Sweden in the first half of 1987. 
The Berlin wall was still separating East from West, 
the internet was not a thing most people knew or cared about,
and computers were not a part of every man's daily life.
Basically life was pretty shitty.

Good thing the internet boom of the 90's came to the rescue.
I got to ride the wave early on as my dad worked with IT and we always had a computer at home,
long before any of my friends did.

I created some of those old school websites of the 90's, you know kinda like the Space Jam [website.](http://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm)

In high school I took a course in web design, but this was back in the day; Internet Explorer was a major pain in the ***,
Flash was all the rage and JavaScript was kinda frowned upon. 

But when I graduated I was sick of school, I wanted to do anything rather than study anymore.
So I went travelling - for 7 years. Because that seemed like a normal and sane thing to do.

My first big adventure to Canada back in 2008 kicked off a strong passion for photography. 
I bought my first SLR as a christmas gift for myself and started to learn the basics by trial and error combined with reading tons of material online and in books.
Nowadays I'm really into the mirrorless systems by Sony, they're just so fast - it's awesome!

Of course I love to travel, I mean who doesn't? 
I mostly travel completely solo and just make friends along the way.
Sometimes I go away and stay long gone -
I managed to stay in Canada for 1 year and in Australia for a total of 2 and a half years.
Some think I'm brave for going solo - others think I'm crazy.
To me it's not bravery: in reality I don't mind being on my own, all alone,
it's not really a big deal for me. 

So maybe that makes me crazy then?

But I'm not a loner, even though I like to be a lone wolf out in the big bad world; I've always enjoyed team sports.

To stay fit I lace up my shoes, play some floorball and score some goals.
I don't play in the best team, 
but I play with some good guys and I mostly just try to stay in shape while having fun at the same time.

####Why Study?

Well, a lot happens in 9 years - that's the time it took me after graduating Gymnasiet (Swedish High School) until I hit the books again.
During my 7 years on the roam I tried a bit of everything, 
nothing really struck a chord within me though and by spring of 2014 I was sick of tending bar.
So I started to look for new alternatives.
I knew I didn't want to be tied down to one place for the rest of my life to make a career.
The good news, I found out, is that everything has changed.
The internet provides you with insane opportunities that our parents couldn't even dream about.

You can now live in Buenos Aires for example and be employed in Stockholm, or Berlin, or Sydney - it doesn't matter.
But of course this is only one of the major turn ons that I found.
I soon found out that I actually enjoy this kind of work.

So I got on Codecademy and learnt the shit out of HTML and CSS, 
next I started some courses and before I knew it I was applying for a 2 year programme at Linnaeus University and that is where I am today.

####The Future

I will be the next Elon Musk - obviously I'm a big fan of Google's "moon shot" theory.
